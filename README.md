# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project demonstrates the process of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a given dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to clean, visualize, and understand the patterns, trends, and relationships in the data before applying any machine learning models.

## Introduction

This notebook provides an analysis of the dataset, including:

- Checking the structure and types of the data.
- Handling missing data, duplicate records, and other data issues.
- Generating various visualizations to explore trends, correlations, and distributions.
- Statistical analysis to summarize the data.

## Data Preprocessing

In this section, the following steps were taken:

1. **Loading the dataset**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Handling missing values**: Missing data was either dropped or imputed depending on the column's characteristics.
3. **Data cleaning**: Any irrelevant or duplicate rows were removed.
4. **Feature engineering**: New features were created or transformed as necessary to improve analysis.
5. **Data normalization**: Scaled the data to a uniform range for better visualization and analysis.

## Conclusion

In this EDA project, I've explored and visualized the dataset to understand the key features and relationships. The insights obtained will help in making informed decisions for further data analysis or model building.

## Dependencies

To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` (if any machine learning algorithms were applied during analysis)
- `jupyter`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
